**1v1 Duel Mode**
---

**1v1 Duel Mode** is a gamemode which pits two players against each other in a ranked best-of-three. 1v1 server maps force the game to be played in this mode.

---
## Teams
The teams in **1v1 Duel Mode** (and most other **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)** by extension) are Yellow and Blue. Items and bases are colored after these teams. (Note the difference from the Red and Green teams in *Missile Wars*.)

---
## Objective
The objective of **1v1 Duel Mode** is to win 2 of 3 matches. The objective of each match is the same as in **[Normal Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/normal#objective)** - destroying the enemy player's portal while defending your own.

**Matches**
Matches are the individual games played within a game of **1v1 Duel Mode**. Each match is identical to a game of **Normal Mode**, except for a few key differences. For each match, a set of 12 items is randomly generated and announced in the chat. The Wind Down **[modifier](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/modifiers.html)** is enabled for the duration of the game, gradually increasing the rate at which items are given to a maximum of one item per second. When a match ends there is a short resting period in which the current status of the game is announced, which is immediately followed by the next match or the end of the game, depending on whether a player has won enough matches. This resting period is also used to clear the arena and reset the Wind Down modifier.

---
## XP
**XP** (short for **experience**) is a ranking system exclusive to **1v1 Duel Mode**.

Players receive or lose XP depending on the outcome of a game of Duel Mode, and XP translates to ranks and boots worn by the player at any time (this is disabled on servers -- see Server Mode Settings). Leaving a game of Duel Mode early starts a 1 minute timeout, and if the player does not rejoin during this timeout period, the game ends due to forfeit (the player who forfeits incurs an XP penalty while the player remaining receives XP compensation).

XP is disabled in server maps.

## Items
The items which can be obtained in **1v1 Duel Mode** are the same as in **Normal Mode**. However, they aren't all accessible at the same time. A set of 12 items is randomly generated for each match, which consists of the following:

* 5 of the following **[Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/)**
  * All **[Normal](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/)** Missiles
  * **[Warhead](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/warhead)**
  * **[Auxiliary](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/auxiliary)**
* 1 **[Lightning](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/)** Missile (**[Thunderbolt](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/thunderbolt)** or **[Hurricane](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/hurricane)**)
* **[Fireball](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**
* **[Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield)** or **[Obsidian Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/obsidian_shield)**
* **[Arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/arrows)**
* **[Splash](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/splash)**
* **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)**
