**Capture the Flag Mode**
---

**Capture the Flag Mode** is a gamemode that is based on the outdoor sport of the same name. It's Capture the Flag with explosions.

---
## Teams
The teams in **Capture the Flag Mode** are Yellow and Blue. Items and bases are colored after these teams. (Note the difference from the Red and Green teams in *Missile Wars*.)

---
## Objective
The objective of **Capture the Flag Mode** is to capture the other team's flags.

Each base has layers made of concrete, with the back layer being end stone that slowly regenerates over time. The usual obsidian line containing the player's spawning point is replaced by a large bedrock platform. Atop the end stone layer are a pair of Flagpoles on which each team's flags fly. The Flagpoles are indestructible, and replace the portals found in most other gamemodes.

Players must spawn and ride **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** to the enemy base, steal both their flags, and then return to their own base with flags in hand, while also defending their own flags with **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)**.

## Stealing and Capturing Flags

Each flag starts in the raised position. To steal a flag that is raised, the player must lower it by breaking the purple stained glass at the base of the Flagpole. Once lowered, the player can steal the flag by breaking the white stained glass at the base of the Flagpole or by walking into it. This turns the player into a Flag Carrier.

**Flag Carriers** are players carrying stolen flags, which appear as banners on their heads. Their capture progress is shown at the top of the screen, and a beacon-like particle effect above their heads is shown to other players to make them easier to spot. The missiles a Flag Carrier spawns fly in the opposite direction they normally do to facilitate the flag's capture.

If a Flag Carrier dies or leaves mid-game, the flag is restored to its Flagpole in the lowered position. A lowered flag cannot be re-raised.

## Items
The main weapon in this gamemode is the **Piercing Pickaxe** (netherite pickaxe with Sharpness I), which replaces the Shooting Saber. Players also have leather armor colored respectively after their team.

The only obtainable items in **Capture the Flag Mode** are **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** (with the exception of **[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special_missiles)**) and **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)** (with the exception of Arrows).

In this gamemode, players can receive up to two **[Canopies](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)** at once.

Players may freely configure which items are active in this gamemode through the **[Item Selection](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)** options in the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/)**.
