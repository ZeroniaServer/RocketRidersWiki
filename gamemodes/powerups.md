**Powerups Mode**
---

**Powerups Mode** is like **[Normal Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/normal)**, except enhanced with... you guessed it... Powerups!

---
## Teams
The teams in **Powerups Mode** are Yellow and Blue. Items and bases are colored after these teams. (Note the difference from the Red and Green teams in *Missile Wars*.)

---
## Objective

The objective of **Powerups Mode** is the same as **[Normal Mode's](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/normal#objective)**: break the enemy portals to win.

However, there is also an indestructible **Powerup Platform** in the center of the arena that players can stand on for 3 seconds to capture it for their team.

Upon capturing the **Powerup Platform**, all players on that team gain **[Powerups](#powerups-items)** every 12 seconds, giving them a major advantage against the other team.

The other team may counter this in three ways:

1. If they stand on the platform, it becomes "contested", at which point no one receives items until there's only one team remaining on the platform. (If all players die while the platform is contested, no one gets items until a new team recaptures the platform.)
2. They can send End Crystals to the **Powerup Platform** by standing on top of the **Crystal Crafter**. Only one End Crystal can be on the **Powerup Platform** at a time and flies randomly to somewhere on top of the platform.
3. They can destroy the enemy portals while their enemies are too busy controlling the **Powerup Platform**.

## Powerups Items

There is a host of **Powerups** that players may obtain while in control of the **Powerup Platform**. Note that none of these items are configurable in the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)**.

Here is a brief description of each of them:

---
### **Special Missiles**

Players may obtain all four missiles in the **[Special Missile](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special_missiles)** category from the **Powerup Platform**. These are exclusively available in **Powerups Mode** and **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**.

---
### **Tipped Arrows**

Players may obtain arrows tipped with four different potion effects:
- Blindness for 10 seconds
- Levitation for 5 seconds
- Slowness II for 10 seconds
- Wither III for 7.5 seconds

Unless they pick up additional arrows or the **[Item Stacking game rule](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules#item-stacking)** is enabled, players may only have 4 **Tipped Arrows** of any kind at a time.

---
### **Stinging Shield**

Players may obtain honey bottles that they can drink to launch out a tiny honey block that eventually turns into a **Stinging Shield**.

The **Stinging Shield** is made of beehives with three bees each inside and has an unstable TNT in the middle. When broken or shot, the TNT explodes the bee hives and releases bees that are hostile to the opposite team.

---
### **Lava Splash**

Players may obtain **Lava Splash** bottles that work very similarly to normal **[Splash](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/splash)** bottles, except they place lava instead. The lava may be used to melt any players or **[Canopies](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)** it comes into contact with.

Lava may be used in combination with water from normal **Splashes** to form cobblestone, stone, or even obsidian (this is vanilla behavior). This is all eventually removed when the **[arena clears](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/arena_clearing)**.

---
### **Trident**

Players may obtain **Tridents** from the **Powerup Platform**, which are useful for both direct and ranged combat like the **Shooting Saber**. The **Trident** always has Impaling II and Channelling I (although the latter doesn't really do anything...).

If the player is not standing in water, the **Trident** has Loyalty also (although, if the **Trident** falls into the void, it does not return to the player).

Alternatively, if the player is standing in water, the **Trident** automatically gains Riptide, allowing them to launch themself (and making **[Splashes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/splash)** even more useful!).

A **Trident** may also be used to destroy a **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)**.

---
### **Elytra**

Players may obtain low-durability **Elytra** which replace their chestplate slot (normally occupied by a leather tunic) while still offering the same armor protection.

**Elytra** allow for increased travel ability, but to a finite extent. Since they only have 5 durability, the **Elytra** break after relatively short flights.

Moreover, they automatically break when the player is near the enemy base in order to prevent overpowered shortcuts to winning the game. 

**Elytra** do <ins>NOT</ins> come with fireworks, so they must be used sparingly and strategically.

---
### **Totem of Undying**

Players may obtain **Totems of Undying** from the **Powerups Platform**. The totem saves them from all forms of death except falling in the void while held.

---
### **Infinity Saber**

Players may obtain temporary **Infinity Sabers** from the **Powerups Platform**. Once received, their normal **Shooting Saber** has Infinity for 30 seconds, allowing them to shoot infinite arrows at their opponents.

If players do not have arrows at the moment when they receive the **Infinity Saber** , then they get one free arrow to use. Also note that the Infinity enchantment does not apply to **[Tipped Arrows](#tipped-arrows)** (this is vanilla behavior).

---
### **Slap Fish**

Players may obtain temporary **Slap Fishes** (cooked cod with Knockback 3) from the **Powerups Platform**. If they slap an enemy with their **Slap Fish**, the **Slap Fish** is consumed from their inventory and a fish flop sound plays while the enemy goes flying away from all the knockback.
