**Chase Mode**
---

**Chase Mode** is a free-for-all racing-style gamemode that is only available in public world downloads. In essence, it is a racing game with a highly explosive twist!

---
## Teams
Unlike the other gamemodes, in **Chase Mode**, all players are put on the Blue team. This gamemode is a free-for-all, and friendly fire is enabled and encouraged.

---
## Objective
The objective of **Chase Mode** is to reach the **Finish Flag** first.

The **Finish Flag** is an indestructible checkered flag which spawns on top of the Yellow team base. Two obsidian staircases leading up to the flag are embedded in the back of the base, along with airways to facilitate movement. These replace the portals found in most other gamemodes.

Players start on the Blue base and must spawn and ride **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** to reach the **Finish Flag**, while also defending themselves and hindering other players with **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)**.

---
## Items

The only obtainable items in **Chase Mode** are **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** (with the exception of **[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special_missiles)**) and **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)**.

Players may freely configure which items are active in this gamemode through the **[Item Selection](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)** options in the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/)**.
