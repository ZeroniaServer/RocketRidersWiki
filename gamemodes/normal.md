**Normal Mode**
---

**Normal Mode** is the default gamemode for **Rocket Riders** and matches very closely with the original gameplay of *Missile Wars*. 

---
## Teams
The teams in **Normal Mode** (and most other **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)** by extension) are Yellow and Blue. Items and bases are colored after these teams. (Note the difference from the Red and Green teams in *Missile Wars*.)

---
## Objective
The objective of **Normal Mode** is to destroy the enemy portals.

Each base is made of three layers of 5-block-thick stained glass with two portals behind it that must be broken to win the game.

Players must spawn and ride **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** to damage the enemy base and destroy the portals behind, while also defending their own portals with **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)**.

---
## Items
The main weapon in this gamemode is the **Shooting Saber** (bow with Sharpness V and Flame). Players also have leather armor colored respectively after their team.

The only obtainable items in **Normal Mode** are **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** (with the exception of **[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special_missiles)**) and **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)**.

Players may freely configure which items are active in this gamemode through the **[Item Selection](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)** options in the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/)**.
