The **Slasher** is a glass-encased missile with not much TNT. It can slash straight through [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield).

Its special properties are that it is resistant to arrows, can bust through two layers of blocks, is waterproof, and is nearly impossible to defuse.
