**Normal Damage Missiles**
---

These are neither as fast as [Lightning Speed Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning) nor as destructive as [Heavy Damage Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy); just somewhere in between. There are 10 missiles in this category:

- [A.N.T](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/ant) - Stands for Almost No TNT. It is one of the smallest functional missiles, made with only two TNT blocks.  
- [Blade](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/blade) - A sword-shaped missile. Breaking the slime block on the side will drop down 3 bomber TNT below it.
- [Catapult](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/catapult) - Once it contacts a wall, it launches 2 TNT blocks out. You can also launch TNT by breaking the back slime block.
- [Chronullifier](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/chronullifier) - Uses a unique observer engine with the same speed as non-observer engines.
- [Citadel](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/citadel) - Good for surprise attacks. You can climb inside the missile using the trapdoor on top of it.
- [Elder Guardian](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/elderguardian) - An upgrade from the Guardian in Missile Wars, the Elder Guardian is bigger and covers the TNT better.
- [Gemini](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/gemini) - A twin missile. If one side is stopped, the other side of the missile will keep going.
- [Lifter](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/lifter) - Lifts its warhead up by 3 blocks when it hits an obstacle.
- [Slasher](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/slasher) - A glass-encased missile with not much TNT. It can slash straight through [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield).
- [TomaTwo](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/tomatwo) - A missile inspired by the Tomahawk from Missile Wars. This missile uses an observer engine.
