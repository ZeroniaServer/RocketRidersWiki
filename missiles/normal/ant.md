The **A.N.T.** stands for Almost No TNT. It is one of the smallest functional missiles in Minecraft, made with only two TNT blocks.

It has the special properties of traveling at "medium speed" (2.2 m/s), having a tiny explosion, busting through 1-block [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield), and being practically impossible to defuse.

Based on __[Wout12345 and G4me4u's 11-block TNT missile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBqGwnsqWuQ)__.
