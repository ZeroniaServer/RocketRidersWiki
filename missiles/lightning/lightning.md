# Lightning Speed Missiles
---

These travel faster than any missiles (besides the [Hypersonic](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/hypersonic)) in the game, at the cost of being harder to deploy and ride successfully.

- [Hurricane](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/hurricane) - Bears much resemblance to the Lightning from Missile Wars, but features more TNT and a tight design.
- [Thunderbolt](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/thunderbolt) - Breaking too much TNT may stop this missile, but its length and 2x2 form factor make it easier to ride.
