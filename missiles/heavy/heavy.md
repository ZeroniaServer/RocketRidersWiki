# Heavy Damage Missiles
---

These deal the most damage of any missiles (besides [Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special)) in the game, at the cost of being more dangerous to ride without disarming.

- [Auxiliary](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/auxiliary) - This missile has 6 trigger TNT in it, making it risky to defuse.
- [Juggerbuster](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/juggerbuster) - This missile has the power of a Juggernaut plus the ability to bust through [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield).
- [Rifter](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/rifter) - An observer engine missile with plenty of TNT to blow up a portal.
- [Warhead](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/warhead) - A Juggernaut-style missile. When it hits a wall, a piston will cover up the trigger TNT.
