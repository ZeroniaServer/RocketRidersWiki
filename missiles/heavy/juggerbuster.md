The **Juggerbuster** is a Juggernaut-ShieldBuster hybrid, in that it has the power of a Juggernaut plus the ability of a ShieldBuster.

Its special properties are that its explosion deals collateral damage, it has multiple triggers, it can bust through 1-block thick [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield), and it is nearly impossible to defuse once it detonates.
