The **Duplex** is like a ShieldBuster but takes a more creative approach. Instead of going through a [Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield), it will blow it up and keep on flying.

Its special properties are that it contains TNT minecarts, explodes twice, and has multiple trigger TNT.
