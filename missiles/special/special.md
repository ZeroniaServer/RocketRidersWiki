**Special Missiles**
---

These missiles are available exclusively in [Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups) and [Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap), as they are each too overpowered for general gameplay.

- [Broadsword](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/broadsword) - A fast and powerful missile that bombs a lot of TNT. It's like three Swords combined!
- [Bullet](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/bullet) - With 44 TNT, 12 of which being triggers, the Bullet makes all missiles look like an [A.N.T.](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/ant)
- [Duplex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/duplex) - Like a ShieldBuster, but instead of going through a [Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield), it will blow it up and keep on flying.
- [Hypersonic](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/hypersonic) - The fastest missile in the game. It might be very hard to get on this one!
