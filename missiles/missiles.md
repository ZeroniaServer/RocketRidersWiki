# Missiles
--- 
Rocket Riders features **20 all new, community-made missiles**. The missiles are divided into four categories, ranging in speed, explosive power, and availability in certain [gamemodes.](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)

Each category is listed below along with all the missiles in them. Click on the name of each missile to see more information about it!

**Normal Damage Missiles**
---
These are neither as fast as [Lightning Speed Missiles](#lightning-speed-missiles) nor as destructive as [Heavy Damage Missiles](#heavy-damage-missiles); just somewhere in between. There are 10 missiles in this category:

- [A.N.T](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/ant) - Stands for Almost No TNT. It is one of the smallest functional missiles, made with only two TNT blocks.  
- [Blade](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/blade) - A sword-shaped missile. Breaking the slime block on the side will drop down 3 bomber TNT below it.
- [Catapult](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/catapult) - Once it contacts a wall, it launches 2 TNT blocks out. You can also launch TNT by breaking the back slime block.
- [Chronullifier](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/chronullifier) - Uses a unique observer engine with the same speed as non-observer engines.
- [Citadel](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/citadel) - Good for surprise attacks. You can climb inside the missile using the trapdoor on top of it.
- [Elder Guardian](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/elder_guardian) - An upgrade from the Guardian in *Missile Wars*, the Elder Guardian is bigger and covers the TNT better.
- [Gemini](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/gemini) - A twin missile. If one side is stopped, the other side of the missile will keep going.
- [Lifter](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/lifter) - Lifts its warhead up by 3 blocks when it hits an obstacle.
- [Slasher](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/slasher) - A glass-encased missile with not much TNT. It can slash straight through [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield).
- [TomaTwo](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal/tomatwo) - A missile inspired by the Tomahawk from *Missile Wars*. This missile uses an observer engine.

**Heavy Damage Missiles**
---
These deal the most damage of any missiles (besides [Special Missiles](#special-missiles)) in the game, at the cost of being more dangerous to ride without disarming.

- [Auxiliary](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/auxiliary) - This missile has 6 trigger TNT in it, making it risky to defuse.
- [Juggerbuster](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/juggerbuster) - This missile has the power of a Juggernaut plus the ability to bust through [Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield).
- [Rifter](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/rifter) - An observer engine missile with plenty of TNT to blow up a portal.
- [Warhead](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy/warhead) - A Juggernaut-style missile. When it hits a wall, a piston will cover up the trigger TNT.

**Lightning Speed Missiles**
---
These travel faster than any missiles (besides the [Hypersonic](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/hypersonic)) in the game, at the cost of being harder to deploy and ride successfully.

- [Hurricane](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/hurricane) - Bears much resemblance to the Lightning from *Missile Wars*, but features more TNT and a tight design.
- [Thunderbolt](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning/thunderbolt) - Breaking too much TNT may stop this missile, but its length and 2x2 form factor make it easier to ride.


**Special Missiles**
---
These missiles are available exclusively in [Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups) and [Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap), as they are each too overpowered for general gameplay.

- [Broadsword](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/broadsword) - A fast and powerful missile that bombs a lot of TNT. It's like three Swords combined!
- [Bullet](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/bullet) - With 44 TNT, 12 of which being triggers, the Bullet makes all missiles look like an [A.N.T.](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/ant)
- [Duplex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/duplex) - Like a ShieldBuster, but instead of going through a [Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield), it will blow it up and keep on flying.
- [Hypersonic](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/hypersonic) - The fastest missile in the game. It might be very hard to get on this one!
