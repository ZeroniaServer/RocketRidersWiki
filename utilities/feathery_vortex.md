**Feathery Vortex**
---

ok so basically if you throw a [Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex) egg at blocks it might just spawn a chicken but *AcTuAlLy* the chicken turns into a **Feathery Vortex** and it's really cool because it just explodes whenever anybody walks into it or whenever else a normal [Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex) would explode and then you get an epic hidden achievement and yeah that's about it thanks for reading

### Gamemode Specific Behavior

oh crap wait there's more right ok so these bad boys aren't in [1v1 Duel Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/duel) because that would just be dumb and unfair right

also they don't exist in [Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap) because instead eggs become epic cool ICBM explosions that go boom boom pow bam and that means no vortex (sadge)

but yeah they exist everywhere else so have fun with that nerds
