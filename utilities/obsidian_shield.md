**Obsidian Shield**
---

**Obsidian Shields** are like regular **[Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield)**, but they are made out of crying obsidian, take a smaller 5x5 diamond shape, and contain a special glass pane in the middle that may be broken 3 times to destroy it. For each time the glass pane is broken, it changes color to reflect the stage of breakage, from purple to magenta to pink. Unless destroyed ingame, **Obsidian Shields** remain on the map until the **[arena is cleared](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/arena_clearing)**.

During the game, players may receive enderman spawn eggs that they can use to deploy **Obsidian Shields**. When placed, these summon a punchable dragon fireball, and when punched, the dragon fireball places an **Obsidian Shield** wherever it lands after a maximum 1.5 seconds of flight. In this way, their deployment is similar to a regular **[Fireball](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**, but their functionality is similar to a regular **[Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield)**.

### Use Cases

Much of the same uses of regular **[Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield#use-cases)** also apply to **Obsidian Shields**, so this page will not cover those. However, seeing as **Obsidian Shields** are deployed differently and consist primarily of a blast-resistant, immovable material, they also have notable differences in their use cases as described below.

Players may use **Obsidian Shields** to directly counter an enemy **[missile](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** headed their way by sending the dragon fireball towards the missile, as they would with regular **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)** and **[Nova Rockets](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/nova_rocket)**. Since pistons cannot move crying obsidian, the missile is practically guaranteed to stop and, if not already disarmed, explode. However, the more explosions that occur near the **Obsidian Shield**, the more the glass pane in the middle breaks, and when that happens 3 times, the entire shield breaks, too.

**Obsidian Shields** may also be used to provide cover/protection or deter enemies chasing the player when placed directly on the floor. They may also be strategically placed to create staircases and gain height advantages in a manner similar to the "Shield-stacking" technique with regular **[Shields](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/shield)** (keep in mind, this is still just as frowned upon if you wish to be a good sport).

### Gamemode-Specific Differences

In **[Capture the Flag Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)**, **Obsidian Shields** may not be deployed in a close proximity of the flag poles. This prevents overpowered defensive strategies and never-ending games.
