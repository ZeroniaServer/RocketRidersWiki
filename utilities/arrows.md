**Arrows**
---

In most gamemodes (**[Capture the Flag](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)** being the sole exception), players use a **Shooting Saber** (bow enchanted with Flame and Sharpness V) as their main weapon for both melee and ranged attacks.

While the **Shooting Saber** is useful enough on its own for close combat, it is completely useless for long-distance attacks without the player receiving **arrows**.

**Arrows** come in stacks of 4 (unlike the stacks of 3 in *Missile Wars*), replenish up to 4 if players have already shot some, and prefer to enter the player's offhand unless occupied.

Players can also pick up **arrows** shot by themselves/other players from the ground, which allows them to obtain more than the normal 4 **arrows** in their inventory (to clarify: this is intended behavior).

### Use Cases

**Arrows** are more useful than you'd think! You can shoot **arrows** at:
- enemy players, to deal direct damage plus additional fire damage.
- TNT (as well as **[End Crystals](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#crystal-platform)** and the TNT Minecarts in the **[Duplex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/duplex)**), to ignite **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** and cause explosions.
- a **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)**, to instantly explode it (also killing the arrow in the process).
- **[Canopies](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)**, either at the log to "fire-poof" them or at the leaves to set them on fire.
- **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**, to launch or deflect them.

### Gamemode Specific Behavior

In **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, players can receive up to 4 additional **[tipped arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#tipped-arrows)** and **[Infinity Sabers](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#infinity-saber)** that shoot infinite (non-tipped) **arrows** while in control of the **[Powerup Platform](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#powerup-platform)**. **Arrows** may also be used to set off **[End Crystals](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#crystal-platform)**.

In **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**, players always receive a new stack of 4 **arrows** upon respawning.

In **[Capture the Flag Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)**, players have **Piercing Pickaxes** as their main weapons and thus do not receive **arrows**.
