**Splash**
---

The **Splash** is ~~the most useful item~~ a throwable water bottle that places a temporary 2x2 stream of water wherever it lands. Water placed by the **Splash** cannot replace non-air blocks.

The motion of the **Splash** projectile in **Rocket Riders** is custom-designed and does not behave like normal splash potion bottles in Minecraft. This is in order to ensure it can be used reliably to save players from fall damage, among other uses (as detailed below).

### Use Cases

**Splashes** are actually incredibly useful â€” more than anyone else truly seems to recognize or appreciate. *Hmph.*

Here's **Rocket Riders** co-creator Evtema3's **TOP TEN REASONS WHY SPLASHES ARE USEFUL**:
1. You can prevent fall damage when falling from a large height by throwing a **Splash** on the floor.
2. You can slow down enemies chasing you by throwing a **Splash** behind you.
3. You can save yourself from falling into the void by throwing a **Splash** against a surface and climbing up the water stream.
4. You can prevent explosions by throwing a **Splash** onto the TNT. (This is part of the **They're Useful!** **[achievement](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/achievements)**!)
5. You can restart a **[missile](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** by throwing a **Splash** to update a piston/observer in the engine.
6. You can also disable a **missile** by throwing a **Splash** to update a piston/observer in the engine.
7. You can put yourself out when you're on fire by throwing a **Splash** against yourself.
8. You can throw a **Splash** on a **[Canopy](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)** to "water" it, thereby extending its duration by 5 seconds. (You can also put out a fire-poofed **Canopy** by throwing a **Splash** onto the leaves; however, the leaves will decay rapidly anyway, so this isn't really as useful.)
10. You can put out the fire in flame **[arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/arrow)** by throwing a **Splash** and having the arrows fly into the water.
11. You can completely destabilize a **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)** by throwing a **Splash** inside it. The placed water triggers the **Vortex** to explode while at the same time negating explosion damage.

### Gamemode/Modifier Specific Behavior

In **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, players may obtain a **[Lava Splash](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#lava-splash)**, which functions exactly the same as a normal **Splash** but places a 2x2 stream of lava wherever it lands instead. The water and lava may be combined to form cobblestone, smooth stone, and even obsidian, which is all intended and all cleaned up during **[arena clears](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/arena_clearing)**.

The **Splash** is not obtainable in **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**.

When the **[Splash Streams](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/modifiers#splash-streams)** modifier is enabled, **Splashes** (including the **[Lava Splash](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#lava-splash)**) will place down permanent streams instead of temporary streams.
