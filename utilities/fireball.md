**Fireball**
---

**Fireballs** work exactly the same in Rocket Riders as they do in *Missile Wars*: Place the blaze spawn egg down on the ground to spawn a **Fireball**, and punch it to launch it in a given direction.

In general, **Fireballs** destroy any blocks they come into contact with (depending on the blast resistance of the material), set temporary fire wherever they land, and deal damage and knockback to enemy players they hit.

### Use Cases

Their most destructive use is being launched directly at TNT (as well as [End Crystals](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#crystal-platform) and [TNT Minecarts](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special/duplex)) to instantly explode it.

They may be launched at other blocks in a [missile](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles), such as the pistons/slime blocks in the engine, to disable that missile. Moreover, they can be launched at a base to deal slight damage to the base.

They can also be launched at [Canopies](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy) to either "fire-poof" the **Canopy** if they hit the log or mow through and set aflame any leaves they pass through.

A quite niche final use is redirecting or launching other **Fireballs** (or even stationary [Obsidian Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/obsidian_shield) fireballs) they come into contact with.

Note that they cannot be launched directly at exposed portals to end the game (in most [gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes), anyway) unless the **Snipe Portals** [game rule](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules) is enabled. They also do not interact with [Vortices](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex).

### Gamemode Specific Behavior

In [Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap), normal Fireballs become **Cluster Fireballs**, which create 4 duplicate Fireballs that travel in the same direction as the original Fireball once they are punched.
