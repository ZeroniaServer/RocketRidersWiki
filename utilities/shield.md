**Shield**
---

**Shields** are throwable snowballs that place a 7x7 upright disk of glass and glass panes (colored respectively to the team of the thrower) wherever they end up after 1 second of uninterrupted flight. Unless broken or exploded, the **Shield** remains on the map until the **[arena is cleared](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/arena_clearing)**.

### Use Cases

Shields are very useful for stopping **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)**. When a Shield is thrown in front of a missile, it presents an obstacle that the missile may not be able to pass through due to the 12-block piston push limit, forcing it to stop and (if not already disarmed) detonate and explode.

Note that the above does not always work if the missile has Shield-busting properties, or otherwise, if there are enough blocks removed from the missile for it to continue safely through the Shield. A better technique in this case is to throw the Shield inside of a missile in flight so that it may replace some critical blocks (pistons, slime blocks, observers, etc.) and thus render the missile immobile.

Shields also block **[arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/arrows)**, **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**, **[Nova Rockets](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/nova_rocket)**, and similar projectiles from hitting the player or a missile.

In a similar vein, a Shield may be thrown in front of a **[Canopy](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)** ender pearl to prevent the **Canopy** from spawning, or thrown in front of a player who is about to jump onto a missile to prevent that player from making the landing.

When thrown inside of a **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)**, a Shield occludes the **Vortex** and forces it to explode. Also, when thrown inside the log of a **[Canopy](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)**, the log breaks and the leaves rapidly decay, thus shortening the Canopy's duration.

Similar to **[arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/arrows)**, the Shield snowball projectile itself can be used to launch or deflect **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**.

Shields can also be used to protect and reinforce damaged areas in the base if thrown against the wall. Moreover, the top of a Shield can afford solid ground and protection to a player away from their base.

Through a technique known as "Shield-stacking," several Shields can be thrown on top of each other and mined into a staircase that gives players significant upper ground. Shields may also be thrown downwards to allow players to "low-ride," or travel on missiles beneath the usual playing area. (Although ill-advised if you wish to be a good sport, these are both undeniably valid strategies.)

### Gamemode Specific Behavior

In **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, Shield snowball projectiles can be used to deal knockback to **[Bees](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#stinging-shield)** and set off **[End Crystals](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#crystal-platform)**.
