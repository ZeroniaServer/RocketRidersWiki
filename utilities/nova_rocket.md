**Nova Rocket**
---

The **Nova Rocket** is given to players as a loaded firework crossbow. When a player shoots the firework out, the crossbow breaks and the firework flies out in a straight line, leaving a trail of particles colored after the the player's team. It will then explode whatever it hits first or wherever it ends up after a maximum 1.5 seconds of flight.

In addition, the **Nova Rocket** explosion launches any nearby enemy players into the air (via 4 ticks of Levitation 60), dealing additional firework damage to those players at their peak height (15 ticks after they are first hit). If the resultant explosion kills any players, the player who shot the **Nova Rocket** is credited for the kill.

When two enemy **Nova Rocket** fireworks collide during flight, a green particle burst known as a **Nova Rocket Collision** occurs, dealing increased explosion damage at the point of collision. In this circumstance, no players are credited for the kill.

### Use Cases

The **Nova Rocket** may be used in a very similar manner as **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)** to destroy or otherwise disable enemy **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)**. Since they have a limited range, the **Fireball** may be a better choice for more distant targets, but since **Nova Rockets** fire instantly and also launch the players they hit, they may be more preferable in some cases.

The **Nova Rocket** may also be used to instantly explode enemy **[Canopies](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/canopy)**. Such an explosion is practically guaranteed to also instantly kill any players on top of the **Canopy**.

Like **[arrows](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/arrow)**, the **Nova Rocket** can be shot at a **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)** to instantly explode it (also killing the firework in the process).

Also, like **Fireballs**, **Nova Rockets** may be launched at the middle glass pane in an **[Obsidian Shield](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/obsidian_shield)** to weaken it by one damage stage and perhaps destroy it.

Note that they cannot be launched directly at exposed portals to end the game (in most **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)**, anyway) unless the **[Snipe Portals game rule](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules#snipe-portals)** is enabled.

### Gamemode Specific Behavior

In **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**, players may use **Nova Rockets** defensively against their teammates as friendly fire is enabled and only Blue team is joinable. **Nova Rocket Collisions** are impossible in this circumstance, but players may be launched or may even launch themselves with **Nova Rockets**.

In **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, **Nova Rockets** can be used to set off **[End Crystals](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups#crystal-platform)**.

The **Nova Rocket** is not obtainable in **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**.
