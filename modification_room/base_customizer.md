**Base Customizer**
---

At the back of the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)**, there is a **Base Customizer** where players may decorate the bases by choosing from a selection of **base details** in different positions of the base. They may also preview what these would look like in a mock-up base.

On the **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net)** version of **Rocket Riders**, since the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)** is unavailable, **map presets** like *New Dawn* and *Spikes* (as well as options for none or random details) are available and arbitrarily paired with each of four **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)** as voting options.

Also note that in **[1v1 Duel Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/duel)**, base details are not configurable and always disabled.

Each possible base detail position and all of its options (as well as what presets they may come from) are listed below:

---
### Top Details

These go directly on the top surface of the base.
- *Arch* (default, part of the *New Dawn* preset)
- *Towers*
- *Spikes* (part of the *Spikes* preset)
- *None*

---
### Top Sides Details

These go on either side of the upper-front face of the base, generally branching off from the top surface.
- *Platform* (default, part of the *New Dawn* preset)
- *Spikes* (part of the *Spikes* preset)
- *Cannons*
- *None*

---
### Middle Details

These go on the middle-front face of the base or take up the entire front surface of the base.
- *Slime Pads* (default, part of the *New Dawn* preset)
- *Spikes* (part of the *Spikes* preset)
- *Layered* (incompatible with [Bottom Details](#bottom-details))
- *None*

---
### Bottom Details

These go on the lower-front face of the base.
- *Slime Pad* (default, part of the *New Dawn* preset)
- *Spikes* (part of the *Spikes* preset)
- *Cannon*
- *None*

---
### Portal Details

These go around or cover the portals behind the base in **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)** with portals.
- *Glass Rim* (default, part of the *New Dawn* preset)
- *Glass Cover*
- *End Stone Cover*
- *Hole in One*
- *None*

Note that only *Glass Rim* and *None* are available on **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net)**, as the others may confer significant gameplay challenges.
