**Modifiers** may be used alongside **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)*** to spice up gameplay. Players may select them in the *Game Customization* section of the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)**.

### Instamine
Players receive Haste 255 and can mine (most) blocks instantly.

### No Fall
Players are immune to fall damage.

### Explosive
TNT, **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**, **[Nova Rockets](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/nova_rocket)**, and the **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)** all do more explosion damage.
