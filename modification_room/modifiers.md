**Modifiers**
---

**Modifiers** may be used alongside **[gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)*** to spice up gameplay. Players may select them in the *Game Customization* section of the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)**.

**Rocket Riders** offers 14 different modifiers, all listed below along with brief descriptions of their effects:

---
### Instamine
Players receive Haste 255 and can mine (most) blocks instantly.

---
### No Fall
Players are immune to fall damage.

---
### Explosive
TNT, **[Fireballs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/fireball)**, **[Nova Rockets](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/nova_rocket)**, and the **[Vortex](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/vortex)** all do more explosion damage.

---
### Rocket Residers
Players cannot leave their bases. (Incompatible with **[Powerups](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, **[Capture the Flag](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)**, and **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**)

---
### Sonar
Players lose night vision so they cannot see blocks. Other players, projectiles, TNT, and **[utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities)** have glowing outlines.

---
### Molerat
A big block of glass spawns in the center of the map, which players must break through to damage the other base. (Causes extreme lag upon initial placement/removal)

---
### Minute Mix
Players receive a new set of 8 items every minute. (Incompatible with **[Wind Down](#wind-down)**)

---
### Surprise Eggs
Players can receive a special spawn egg that spawns a random **[missile](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** (excluding **[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special)** unless **[Chaos](#chaos)** is enabled). These can stack up to 3. (Incompatible with **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**)

---
### Wind Down
After every item given, the time between receiving items decreases, intensifying the game as it continues. (Incompatible with **[Minute Mix](#minute-mix)**; always enabled in **[1v1 Duel Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/duel)**)

For those curious, **Wind Down** decreases the time between receiving items by 2 ticks for each item received until it reaches a minimum of 3 seconds of delay. This may be further reduced in the event of multiple **[Sudden Death](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/sudden_death)** periods.

---
### Splash Streams
Liquids placed by **[Splash](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilities/splash)** bottles are permanent. (Incompatible with **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**)

---
### Spam Click
Players have no delay between melee attacks on enemies. (Essentially 1.8 style combat)

---
### Ninja Jump
Players have increased speed and jump height.

---
### Hardcore
Players have three hearts of health and bases are three blocks thick. (Incompatible with **[Capture the Flag Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)**)

---
### Double Portal
Both portals must be broken to win the game. (Incompatible with **[Capture the Flag Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)** and **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**)

---
### Clutter Collector

---
### Chaos
**[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special)** spawn in regular gameplay. (Incompatible with **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**, **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)**, and **[Crusade Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/crusade)**)

---

**[Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** cannot be spawned inside the enemy base. (Incompatible with **[Rocket Residers](#rocket-residers)**, **[Capture the Flag Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/ctf)**, and **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**)
