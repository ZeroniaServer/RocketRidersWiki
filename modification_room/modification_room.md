# **Modification Room**
--- 

The **Modification Room** is a room in the Lobby that can be used to change the gameplay of **Rocket Riders** to your likings (and, perhaps, your wildest dreams)!

**[Gamemodes](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)**, **[modifiers](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/modifiers)**, **[active items](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)**, **[base designs](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/base_customizer)**, **[game rules](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules)**, and **[world settings](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/world_settings)** can all be configured here.

(Note that this is currently inaccessible on the **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net/)** version of **Rocket Riders** due to server limitations.)

## Item Selection
Through the **[Item Selection](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/item_selection)** interface, players can enable/disable individual items or entire categories of items (**[Normal Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/normal_missiles)**, **[Heavy Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/heavy_missiles)**, **[Lightning Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/lightning_missiles)**, and **[Utilities](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/utilites)**). However, at least one missile or missile category must be enabled for the game to start. Also, **[Special Missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles/special_missiles)** cannot be disabled for gamemodes like **[Swap Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/swap)** and **[Powerups Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/powerups)**.

## Base Customization
There is a variety of **base details** to select, including arches, slime platforms for height advantages, towers, 1-time TNT cannons, and more. These can be visualized in the **[Base Customizer](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/base_customizer)** and customized to your desires.

**[Portal details](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/base_customizer#portal-details)** can also be used to make it more difficult to explode the portals, if players are up for a challenge. For instance, the *Hole in One* detail adds an obsidian layer to the portals with 1 hole in it for TNT to go through. This is obviously the most difficult one, but options like glass covers/rims or end stone covers are also available.

---
## Game Rules
The **Modification Room** contains options for **[game rules](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules)**, such as item delay and whether tying is possible (tying occurs when both teams destroy each othersâ€™ portals within 5 seconds of each other, starting a **[Sudden Death](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/sudden_death)** period), missiles can be spawned inside the portal (Pierce Prevention), items can be stacked, or players can have more items than what fits in their hotbar. There are also ways to reset options to defaults or repeat options for up to 4 games.

---
## World Settings
There are also options for **[world settings](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/world_settings)**, like daytime and whether there are **[credits armor stands](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/credits_armor_stands)** for all 80+ playtesters of the game visible in the Lobby.

---
## Confirming Settings
Once finished customizing game settings in the **Modification Room**, players can click the _Confirm Settings_ sign at the bottom to **[clear the arena](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/arena_clearing)** and start a new game.

A message in chat informs players about the active **[gamemode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)**, **[modifiers](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/modifiers)**, and any other relevant information when the game is ready to play.

At this point, the **Modification Room** will close, players inside it are teleported back to the main Lobby, and the join pads for Yellow, Blue, and Spectators are opened.
