**World Settings**
---

The **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)** contains a **World Settings** section with signs to customize more world-related features of the map.

There is also a **Restore Default World Settings** sign in order to restore these settings to their defaults.

The following world settings are available to be configured:

---
### Daytime

Players may use this setting to set the time of day (thereby determining the sky's appearance) from 0 to 23999 ticks. By default, this is set to 12925 ticks (sunset).

Clicking on this sign brings up a message in chat with clickable text to change the daytime in increments of 1 tick, 5 ticks, 10 ticks, 100 ticks, and 1000 ticks.

Note that the `doDaylightCycle` gamerule is disabled in the **Rocket Riders** world so the time of day is permanent unless changed here. Also note that operators may use the `/time` command directly instead to configure daytime.

### Player Credits

Players may decide whether to display **[credits armor stands](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/credits_armor_stands)** in the Lobby or not. This is disabled by default in order to reduce lag due to many moving entities.
