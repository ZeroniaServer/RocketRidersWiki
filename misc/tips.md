**Tips**
---

During each game of **Rocket Riders**, one of 20 random tips will be selected and announced in the chat every 45 seconds to provide useful information about the game for new players. The contents of these tips always relate to the currently active **[gamemode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes)**.

Players will always see tips on the **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net)** version of **Rocket Riders**. However, on the downloadable map, they have the ability to disable tips for themselves by clicking on a chat prompt sent after each tip or by running the command `/trigger disableTips` in chat while ingame. Also, tips automatically disable after the player has played 10 rounds of **Rocket Riders**. This only pertains to a given account username in a given installation of **Rocket Riders**.

_Technical note: The system for selecting and announcing tips works very similarly to the system for **Item RNG**, which you can learn more about **[here!](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/behind_the_scenes/item_rng)**_
