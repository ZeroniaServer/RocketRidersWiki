**Sudden Death**
---

When the **[Tie/Sudden Death](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/game_rules#tiesudden-death)** game rule is enabled, players may tie the game if both teams explode their enemies' nether portals within 4 seconds of each other. This initiates a **Sudden Death** period, in which the following occurs:

- The portals are relit, but the bases keep the same level of damage.
- Items are given twice as fast as before (if the **[Minute Mix](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/modifiers#minute-mix)** modifier is not enabled).
- A red tint is applied to the screen.
- Players start with a fresh inventory.
- All previous TNT entities are killed.

The outcome of **Sudden Death** determines the actual "winner," so to say, in tie scenarios. However, in the event of multiple successive ties, multiple **Sudden Death** periods may occur, with the effects of each stacking (i.e. item delay is continually halved until it reaches a minimum of 1 tick).

Since **Sudden Death** determines the true outcome of the game, some **[achievements](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/achievements)** are only rewarded once the 5-second tie window has passed (although, the **Premature Celebration** achievement is rewarded for the team that initially won before a tie!).
