**Credits Armor Stands**
---

At the front of the Lobby train station entrance, there are a couple armor stands with heads, names, and armor for the developers, builders, and other key helpers of the game.

While these developer credits armor stands are always present, there are also other credits armor stands that may be enabled from the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)** under **[World Settings](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room/world_settings)** (note that they are disabled by default for lag reduction purposes).

These credits armor stands represent all [80+ playtesters and participants](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/credits) in the early stages of the game's development and span across the entire width of the front of the Lobby train station. Since there are so many people to account for, the armor stands are split arbitrarily into two different sets that alternate once every armor stand in that set has had its time in the spotlight.

When a credits armor stand is showcased, it floats slightly up and forwards, strikes a random pose, emits some particles, and has a nametag beneath it for the player it represents for 4 seconds. Afterwards, it returns to its original position and marks the armor stand next to it to be shown next in the credits cycle. This way, every player is fairly recognized for their contributions.
