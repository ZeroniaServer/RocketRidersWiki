**Splash Messages**
---

When the game starts, a random "splash message" subtitle is broadcasted on screen to all players. Also, when the game ends, a random splash message is played for the winning players, and a different one is played for the losing players.

These messages are all community-submitted and vary heavily in humor, subject matter, and relevance to the actual game as a result. Some of them probably will not even make sense unless you were "in on the joke," so to say. But they exist anyway, I suppose.

If ~~you're insane~~ you're comfortable parsing through some mcfunctions, you can find a full list of every possible random splash message* (in raw JSON text format) in these three key files from the **[Rocket Riders GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZeroniaServer/RocketRiders)**:

- [`game:randomsplash`](https://github.com/ZeroniaServer/RocketRiders/blob/master/rocketriders/data/game/functions/randomsplash.mcfunction)
- [`game:winsplash`](https://github.com/ZeroniaServer/RocketRiders/blob/master/rocketriders/data/game/functions/winsplash.mcfunction)
- [`game:losesplash`](https://github.com/ZeroniaServer/RocketRiders/blob/master/rocketriders/data/game/functions/losesplash.mcfunction)

If you wish to submit some of your own, visit the `#rr-splashes` channel on the **[Zeronia Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/X9bZgw7)** Who knows, you may see your submission in the next update!

_*Note that some winner/loser splash messages are absent in **[Chase Mode](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/gamemodes/chase)**, as there is only one team and only one player can win._
