**Navigation Book**
---

When players are in the Lobby, their middle hotbar slot is occupied by a **Navigation Book**.

The first page of this book contains clickable "warps" to different areas of the Lobby:
- The front of the train station (`1`)
- The Blue team join pad (`3`)
- The Yellow team join pad (`4`)
- The Spectator join pad (`5`)
- the **[Modification Room](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/modification_room)** (not available on the **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net)** version of **Rocket Riders**) (`2`)
- the **[Missile Display Area](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/missile_display_area)** (`6`)
- the **[Parkour](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/parkour)** (`7`)

Players may also use these warps without accessing the **Navigation Book** through the chat command `/trigger LobbyWarp set #`, where `#` corresponds to the ID of the location being warped to as written at the end of each bullet point above.

Subsequent pages of the **Navigation Book** give a brief overview of how to play the game and brief credits to the developers, builders, and playtesters involved in the game's creation.
