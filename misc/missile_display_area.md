**Missile Display Area**
---

In the back section of the Lobby, players can find the **Missile Display Area**. This is where players can get a good look up close at all 20 **[missiles](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/missiles)** in the game and learn information about each one.

In front of the **Missile Display Area**, there is a lectern on the floor with a **Missile Display** book. Clicking on the name of a missile on the first two pages of the book will load that missile in the **Display Area**.

In addition, holographic statistics for the name, TNT count, speed, and spawn egg are visible in front of the **Display Area**, and a message in chat about the purpose and creator(s) of the missile is sent to the player.

Players may walk directly inside the **Display Area** to examine different angles of the missile design up close! (The missile itself is frozen, as it is surrounded by `moving_piston`, a block players can walk through but pistons cannot push.)
