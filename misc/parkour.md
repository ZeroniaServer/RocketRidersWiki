**Rocket Riders** has its own **Parkour** course beneath the Lobby! This is only accessible via the **[Navigation Book](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/navigation_book)**.

The **Parkour** course has four different sections and a checkpoint for each one.

The sections are themed by color, from green to blue to yellow to red in that order, and they are relatively equal in length.

While players are in the **Parkour**, they receive several control items* in their hotbar that they can use by dropping or offhanding:
- **Return to Checkpoint**: A compass; sends the player to their most recent checkpoint.
- **Quit to Start**: A clock; ends the **Parkour** run and sends the player back to the start of the course.
- **Quit Parkour**: A barrier; ends the **Parkour** run and sends the player back to the Lobby.

_*Note that players receive different control items on the **[CubeKrowd](https://cubekrowd.net)** version of **Rocket Riders** consistent with the server parkour plugin._

If the player logs out or uses a **[Lobby warp](https://zeroniaserver.github.io/RocketRidersWiki/misc/navigation_book)** during their **Parkour** run, their run is canceled. Also, if the player misses a jump and falls on black concrete, they are sent back to their previous checkpoint. If they have not reached a checkpoint yet, their time is reset and they go back to the start of the course.

The player can see their current time (with an accuracy of 0.05 second increments) and current checkpoint in their actionbar whenever they are in an active **Parkour** run.

For each checkpoint the player reaches, their time is announced in chat to them and a sound/particle effect is played. When the player reaches the end of the **Parkour**, their final time is announced to everyone ingame with similar sound/particle effects.

If their new final time is better than their previous time, it is announced in chat and stored in the player's scoreboard data. Also, if it is better than anyone's previous time in that **Rocket Riders** world, that player is put on the Leaderboard at the front of the **Parkour** course.

The **Parkour** course leads the player to an old version of the **Rocket Riders** Lobby, designed by player HolyToiletPaper in 2017. The old Lobby has side corridors with map artwork of the original **Rocket Riders** world, the **Rocket Riders** logo, and the time we played **Rocket Riders** with Cubehamster himself! At the back, there is a pad of green concrete that players may stand on to return to the Lobby.
